		<blockquote>7And I will establish My covenant between Me and between
			you and between your seed after you throughout their generations as
			an everlasting covenant, to be to you for a God and to your seed
			after you.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>8And I will give you and your seed after you the land of
			your sojournings, the entire land of Canaan for an everlasting
			possession, and I will be to them for a God.&quot;</blockquote>
		<blockquote>9And God said to Abraham, &quot;And you shall keep My
			covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their generations.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>10This is My covenant, which you shall observe between Me
			and between you and between your seed after you, that every male
			among you be circumcised.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>11And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin,
			and it shall be as the sign of a covenant between Me and between you.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>12And at the age of eight days, every male shall be
			circumcised to you throughout your generations, one that is born in
			the house, or one that is purchased with money, from any foreigner,
			who is not of your seed.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>13Those born in the house and those purchased for money
			shall be circumcised, and My covenant shall be in your flesh as an
			everlasting covenant.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>14And an uncircumcised male, who will not circumcise the
			flesh of his foreskin-that soul will be cut off from its people; he
			has broken My covenant.&quot;</blockquote>
		<blockquote>- Genesis 17 – First Brit Milah, Translation from
			chabad.org</blockquote>
		<p>This is the first time we see circumcision in the Tanach. God
			commands Abraham circumcise himself and all the members of his
			household to show their commitment to god. Ritual circumcision is one
			of the ways God tells Abraham and his descendants to remember the
			continuing covenant between god and the Jewish people. It outlines
			the punishment of not being circumcised as <font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">קרת</span></font>,
			or being cut off from the Jewish people. In my understanding the
			connects circumcision to community, which is one of the core values I
			want to keep in mind.</p>
		<blockquote>24At a night encampment on the way, the Lord encountered
			him and sought to kill him.
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>25 So Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s
			foreskin, and touched his legs with it, saying, “You are truly a
			bridegroom of blood to me!”
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>26And when He let him alone, she added, “A bridegroom
			of blood because of the circumcision.”</blockquote>
		<blockquote>- Exodus 4:24-26, Translation from JPS Tagged Tanach</blockquote>
		<p>I’ve included this source for a multitude of reasons. First, I
			think it underlines how important brit milah seems to be to god, that
			he was willing to kill Moses for not doing it. It’s a very intense
			scene, with Tziporah presumably saving Moses’ life by performing
			the circumcision herself. The text also makes significant note of the
			blood involved, and connects Moses’ performance in not circumcising
			with his suitability of a husband. For the most part, this feels like
			an outdated source that relies heavily on old gender roles and the
			idea of god as a punishing entity, but I wanted to include it since
			it is a part of your history, and speaks to the religious
			implications of brit milah.</p>
		<blockquote>And he named him Noah, saying, “This one will provide
			us relief from our work and from the toil of our hands, out of the
			very soil which the Lord placed under a curse.”
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote> - Breshit 5:29, translation by JPS Tagged Tanach</blockquote>
		<p>I’ve included this source as an idea for name generation. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSMynBIIdOY">Names
are important</a>, and Noach’s certainly sets his destiny. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4V-N6EEvY">There
are many reasons to choose a name</a>, but considering what path you
			hope your child will take is certainly an admirable one. Noach’s
			name described the path that he would follow, and the name that you
			choose for your child will certainly effect them as well.</p>
		<blockquote>The emperor said to Rabbi Tanḥum: Come, let us all be
			one people. Rabbi Tanḥum said: Very well. But we, who are
			circumcised, cannot become uncircumcised as you are; you all
			circumcise yourselves and become like us.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>- Sanhedrin 39a, translation by Sefaria</blockquote>
		<p>This speaks to the permanence of Circumcision. Circumcising your
			son will forever set him apart as Jewish, there is no returning.
			While, as it has for R’ Tanhum, this could lead to a strong sense
			of belonging which cannot be overcome by even emperors. Should your
			son want to forget his Jewish heritage, for reasons of religion, or
			life safety, circumcising him would thus make it much harder.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<font face="Liberation Serif, serif">We have the custom
				to make a festive meal on the day of the circumcision.</font>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><span lang="he-IL">הג”ה</span></font>
			<font face="Liberation Serif, serif">:
				And it is customary to have a <i>minyan</i> for the circumcision
				meal. And it is called a </font>
			<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><span lang="he-IL">סעוד

		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<font face="Liberation Serif, serif">It is also customary
				to make a festive meal and party on the Shabbat night after the boy
				is born, to come where the baby is and have a tasty treat there. This
				is also a </font>
			<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><span lang="he-IL">סעוד
מצוה</span></font>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<font face="Liberation Serif, serif">Shulchan Aruch,
				Yoreh Deah 265:12, Translation from sourcebook</font>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The idea of celebration of birth is certainly one that I would
			like to highlight. The ritual makes some allusions to it, but the
			festivities would occur outside the main ritual. This text
			understands that the birth of a baby is something to be celebrated,
			how better than with the ancient tradition of food?</p>
		<blockquote>…the reason is that Noach was the first man born after
			the death of Adam, and by calling him Noach he merely expressed the
			hope and prayer that Noach would be able to atone for the iniquity
			which Adam had perpetrated. The word <font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">נח
</span></font>is an allusion to <font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">הנחה</span></font>,
			a relief, reduction in cost, i.e. the curse that mankind suffers
			under, especially the earth, should be lifted now that Adam had been
			replaced by an innocent human being who did not share time on earth
			with Adam who had brought a curse upon mankind.
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">רשבם </span></font>on
			<font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">בראשית כט</span></font>:<font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">ה
</span></font>- Translation from sefaria.org
		</blockquote>
		<p>This speaks to both the existence of names as a hopeful device,
			and also the hope involved in bringing a new person into the world,
			both things that are heavily relied upon by my ritual. By saying that
			Noach was named not only based on his parents hopes, but as a form of
			prayer, Rambam embodies how hopeful it is to bring a child into the
			world. He also notes how the next generation are the leaders of
			tomorrow, and that they embody our hopes and dreams for the world to
			be created.</p>
		<blockquote>Hashem, whose mysterious nature patterns our own, this
			day we prayerfully call this child our child. Let the gender choices
			we make as we name our child be for the good. Let us seek to learn
			the truth about this child's gender from this child over time, and
			let us not force a gender-identity upon this child, based on these
			eight brief days of our acquaintanceship. Hashem, we have long
			awaited this child's arrival in our lives. Let the power of our love
			and anticipation guide us to teach and nurture our children in
			humility, to guide and steer them with strength and beneficent
			authority, and to hold in awareness, that though their naked selves
			are entrusted to our care, much of their truth has yet to be
			revealed.

		<blockquote>Prayer for Making First Decisions About Gender for a
			Child | Shared by Rabbi David Dunn Bauer | From: Ritualwell.org</blockquote>
		<p>I love this text. It understands how important gender will be in
			any child’s life, it supports trans people. I really want the
			ritual to be something that reflects the fluidity of gender, having
			the parents say this prayer as they announce the name of their child
			is extremely powerful to me. It acknowledges the strongly gendered
			ritual that it is connected to, while still respecting that gender is
			not a constant. The parents ask for the ability to understand their
			child as they exist, not as they want them to be. It is so open. I’m
			a big fan.</p>
		<blockquote>IN JUDAISM, a name is not merely a conglomeration of
			letters put together as a convenient way to refer to someone.
			Ideally, it is a definition of the individual – a description of
			his personality and an interpretation of his traits. It may even be a
			portent of the person's future , or perhaps a prayer that the person
			bearing this particular name shall live up to the potential expressed
			in the name.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>…
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>A HISTORIC EVENT needs both hindsight and foresight to be
			interpreted properly. Even after weighing every nuance and as
			balancing the significant against the insignificant occurrences, man
			still struggles with the interpretation of long term implications.
			Many events in contemporary Jewish history have been judged
			differently by Jews with different perspectives. Only with ruach
			hakodesh, the Holy Spirit, i.e., Divinely inspired wisdom, can one
			make a precise evaluation.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>Because we lack such capabilities, R' Shimon Ben Gamliel
			tells us that we do not bestow original names on our children.
			Commentators note, however, that it is proper to use names that
			commemorate events, provided one uses names that had been utilized
			previously. For example, a war has ended and one wishes to name his
			son Shalom (peace); a person witnesses the helping hand of God and
			chooses the name Eliezer (my God aided me); or a refugee fleeing from
			country to country finally finds an area where he can settle and
			build his future selects the name Noach (rest) – all these are
			acceptable (Bris Avos 8:37).</blockquote>
		<blockquote>It is indeed customary to name a child in relation to a
			Jewish holiday or commemorative event that coincides with the child's
			birth. For a boy born on Purim, one might use Mordechai; on Chanukah,
			Mattisyahu or Yehudah; on Pesach, Moshe; on Yom Kippur, Rachamim
			(mercy); on Tishah B'Av, Menachem (comforter) or Nechemiah (God
			comforts); on Succos, the name of the special guest (ushpizin)
			corresponding to that individual day (first day, Avraham, second day
			Yitzchak, etc.). Some name a child with a name found in the weekly
			portion of the Torah reading that corresponds to the child's birth or
			bris.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>The name given to a newborn child is eternal; it behooves
			one to evaluate the choice carefully.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>…</blockquote>
		<blockquote>THERE IS A SPIRITUAL connection between the name of an
			individual and his <font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">נשמה</span></font>,
			soul. The word <font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">נשמה
</span></font>stems from the word, <font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">נשימה
</span></font>breath, for it is the 'breath of God that gives life to
			man (Genesis 2:7). A soul's essence is Divine, and a person's name
			defines this essence. It is interesting to note that the central
			letters of the word <font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">נשמה
</span></font>are <font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">שמ</span></font>,
			name. Indeed some have written that the higher soul comes to the
			child when he is given his name (Sefer Me'or Gadol, cited by Taamei
			HaMinhagim 929, in Kuntros Achron). … Noam Elimelech (Bamidbar)
			advises naming a child after a deceased tzaddik (righteous person).
			When a child is named after the deceased, the latter's soul, which
			dwells in the World of Truth, is aroused. A spiritual affinity is
			thus created between this soul and that of the newborn child which
			has profound effect on the child. Additionally the departed soul is
			itself exalted when the name it bore on this world is again used.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>Given the above, the term <font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">זכר
צדיק לברכה</span></font>, the memory of the righteous is for
			a blessing (Proverbs 10:7), can be interpreted in a novel fashion.
			When one names a child after a deceased tzaddik, thus perpetuating
			that tzaddik's memory, the result will be a twofold blessing, for
			both the child and the deceased will benefit by virtue of the child
			bearing this name. The verse concludes, <font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">ושם
רשעים ירקה</span></font>, but the name of the wicked shall
			decay, which can be understood to mean that the names of evil people
			shall decay and wither because they will not be used (see Yoma 38b).</blockquote>
		<blockquote>…
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>IN CERTAIN SEPHARDIC communities, it is considered
			auspicious (a segulah) for long life for a father to name a child
			after himself. Some in those communities extend the custom to name
			their newborn sons and daughters after a living grandfather or
			grandmother, so that older people, too, have the good fortune and
			blessing of continued long life (Bris Avos).</blockquote>
		<blockquote>…
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>A person's name, like a fire, carries within it enormous
			potential. If it is a symbol of the glowing righteousness of
			generations past, it can illuminate its bearer's future; if it is
			meant to recall the wicked, it can symbolize flames of destruction.
			By reflecting back, we can help our future be bright.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>…</blockquote>
		<blockquote>Our Rabbis taught: In the merit of four acts of restraint
			were the Jews redeemed from Egypt - they did not change their names;
			they did not change their language; they did not disclose each
			other's secrets; and they did not break barriers of morality
			(Bamidbar Rabbah 20:21). In every generation, those who seek to
			assimilate to 'improve the lot of the Jews' eventually water down
			their Jewishness until the mixture of contrasting religious cultures
			and ideas becomes so diluted that the original tenets are no longer
			discernible. In order to survive, the uniqueness of Israel requires
			boundaries to assure its purity. Like water and oil, Jews and the
			nations of the world may exist side by side, but can never mix.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>…</blockquote>
		<blockquote>A MAN'S NAME IS HIS personal identity; his language is
			his communal bond. For the Jews in Egypt there was no breakdown of
			individual identity, nor was there a breach in communal identity. For
			this they were worthy of redemption and thus blossomed into
			nationhood.
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>While names are not the only way - perhaps not even the
			most important way - to preserve Jewish identity, the Egyptian
			experience cannot be ignored. Indeed, many leaders and laymen have
			worked strenuously to foster the adoption and use of Jewish names,
			especially in countries where the cultural and commercial pressures
			toward assimilation are powerful. May the pride in our unique
			identity bring us one step closer to the final redemption.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>Names: Their Choice and Significance, Bris Milah, R
			Paysach Krohn (37-51) (Abridged)</blockquote>
		<p>This source discusses possible roots for a name. I have abbriged
			it, mostly taking out the portions concerning the tanachik history,
			which I do not find interesting. Many different ideas are given for
			the source of a name, from many different customs, which is one of
			the reasons I like this source. It suggests naming the child for a
			descesed Tzadik, which I like, especially if that Tzadik is expanded
			to include modern people who I believe are powerful. I could see
			naming my child Ruth, after the Supreme court Justice, or Paul, after
			the founder of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. I also wanted to
			point out the ties to Judaism a name could have. I would love to name
			my child <font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">ים</span></font>,
			the name which is my Hebrew name, or <font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">אדמה</span></font>,
			but I know that these names would forever mark the child as different
			in English speaking communities. The source also talks about the
			history a name can hold, My initials, CIG, are shared with my
			grandfather, and I could see giving those initials to my child. The
			source also suggests that restraint should be taken in choosing
			names, by saying that a child should not be given a novel name. I
			would also respect this, as another concern for <font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">ים
</span></font>and <font face="David CLM"><span lang="he-IL">אדמה</span></font>.</p>
