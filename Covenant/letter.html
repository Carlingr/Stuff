				Brit milah, or simchat bat are both strongly gendered rituals. As
				someone who is currently very thankful for their gender neutral
				name, I hope that you will choose a name that fits your child, no
				matter what gender they will be. Whatever the ceremony is, I hope
				that you will understand both the irrevocable role gender plays in
				our society (or at least my society, it’d be great if gender
				wasn’t a thing in your society), and that gender is a construct,
				and can change.</p>

				Community. The punishment for not being circumcised is <i>caret</i>,
				which is generally understood to mean being exiled from the Jewish
				community. If you have a son, being circumcised will be a large part
				of his identity. Not being circumcised would make him significantly
				different from his Jewish peers.</p>

				Biblical Commandment. Lord knows I don’t much care about biblical
				punishment right now, but perhaps you will. Anywho, know that
				Avraham was commanded to circumcise at 90, did so, and circumcised
				all of his children. Know that the punishment for not being
				circumcised is <i>caret</i>, which is generally understood to mean
				being exiled from the jewish community. Know that moses was nearly
				killed because he did not circumcise his son. To me, these are not
				good reasons to make a decision, but perhaps they will be for you.</p>
