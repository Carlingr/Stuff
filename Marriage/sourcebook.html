		<h1>Sourcebook</h1>
		<blockquote>18The Lord God said, “It is not good for man to be
			alone; I will make a fitting helper for him.” 19And the Lord God
			formed out of the earth all the wild beasts and all the birds of the
			sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and
			whatever the man called each living creature, that would be its name.
			20And the man gave names to all the cattle and to the birds of the
			sky and to all the wild beasts; but for Adam no fitting helper was
			found. 21So the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon the man; and, while
			he slept, He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that
			spot. 22And the Lord God fashioned the rib that He had taken from the
			man into a woman; and He brought her to the man. 23Then the man said,<br /></blockquote>
		<blockquote>“This one at last<br />
			Is bone of my bones<br />
			And flesh of my flesh.<br />
			This one shall be called Woman,<br />
			For from man was she taken.”</blockquote>
		<blockquote>24Hence a man leaves his father and mother and clings to
			his wife, so that they become one flesh.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>they felt no shame.<br /></blockquote>
		<blockquote> - Genesis 4:28-25, Translation from JPS Tagged Tanach</blockquote>
		<p>I really love how this source describes marriage between two
			people. It is, as usual, annoyingly heteronormative, but does manage
			to say something. It speaks to how important it is for life partners
			to be able to function together and the hope that I would be in a
			relationship where my significant other and I would have a close
			functional relationship. I think the idea of both man and woman being
			naked is also something that I would want – That I would be very
			comfortable with my partner, that there is nothing about me that they
			do not know, that I have nothing hidden.</p>

		<blockquote> - Song of Songs 7, abridged, Translation from JPS Tagged
			Tanach</blockquote>
		<p>It took some digging to find it, but I really love this chapter.
			It really encapsulates the carnality of amorous relationships. I love
			how unrestrained it is in it’s descriptions, but I also really love
			how, while it has a significant amount of breast imagery, it also
			spends a non insignificant amount of time talking about the subject’s
			body as a whole. In some ways it seems less sexualizing than some
			modern texts, because it speaks about loving someone in their
			entirety. I also love how it ends, with a description of the two
			lovers going out to explore. I should hope that my significant other
			would want to explore the world in the same way I do, and would come
			with me to see it.</p>
		<blockquote>1 When a man takes a wife, and marries her, if she finds
			no favor in his eyes, because he found some unseemly thing in her,
			that he writes her a bill of divorcement, and gives it in her hand,
			and sends her out of his house.</blockquote>
		<blockquote> - Deuteronomy Chapter 24, Translation from sourcebook.</blockquote>
		<p>For the most part, I hat this source. It is womanizing, it is
			heteronormative, it’s sexist. However, it does give some biblical
			foundation for divorce, and I think that having that foundation is
			grounds enough to include it, since I would not want marriage to be
			continued if one of the partners no longer wishes to be a part of it.
			That said, I also think there is some value to working through the
			challenges to relationships with the objective of making them
			stronger in the end</p>
		<blockquote>Rabbi Elazar teaches: That which is written &quot;make
			for him a support opposite him (Breishit 2:18),&quot; if he is
			worthy, she will be a support for him, if he is not worthy, she will
			be against him.</blockquote>
		<blockquote> - Talmud Bavli, Yivamot 63, Translation from
			sourcebook.</blockquote>
		<p>I hope my partner feels comfortable telling me I’m an idiot.
			Honestly I have a hard time being around people who don’t challenge
			me when I’m wrong. But I would also want to support them and have
			them support me in our endeavors.</p>
		<blockquote>R. Jose met Elijah and asked him: It is written, “I
			will make him a help”; how does a woman help a man? The other
			[Elijah] replied: If a man brings wheat, does he chew the wheat!? If
			flax, does he put on the flax!? Does she not, then, bring light to
			his eyes and put him on his feet!?</blockquote>
		<blockquote> - Talmud Bavli, Yivamot 63, Translation from
			sourcebook.</blockquote>
		<p>I think that this speaks to the give and take that needs to happen
			in a marriage. I would imagine that in my marriage there would be
			times when I would ask my partner to do things that I don’t have
			the time or energy to do, and they would do the same for me. I want a
			marriage where we are both working together towards a common goal,
			where we finish the work of the other one as needed.
		</p>
		<blockquote>Why did the Sages enact that a woman should receive a
			ketubah? It is in order that divorcing one’s wife should not be
			taken lightly.</blockquote>
		<blockquote> - Talmud Bavli, Yevamot 89a</blockquote>
		<p>As I said somewhere above, I think marriage will have ups and
			downs. If either party want’s to dissolve the marriage I will do it
			whole heartedly, I could not be happy if my partner was not happy.
			However, I also agree with what John Green often says about
			relationships, that they have ups and downs, and that it is important
			to understand that there is an amount of sticking it out through
			challenges, and that the love in a relationship will ebb and flow.</p>
		<blockquote>The third opinion is that chuppah consists of the husband
			and wife setting up a house together. Since as man and wife they will
			be living together, any manner in which they do so symbolically
			constitutes chuppah. As soon as the two are in a single domain, the
			nesuin is complete, and they are man and wife. The third opinion is
			also alluded to in the Torah. … This indicates that coming together
			in one house makes the couple man and wife.</blockquote>
		<blockquote> - Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Made in Heaven</blockquote>
		<p>I really love the idea of a couple coming together to build a
			house, and that being the creation of a couple. I think that
			cohabitation is a hallmark of psychological intimacy. I want to have
			a relationship with my significant other where we work together to
			build our lives, where we create things <i><u>with</u></i><i><span style="text-decoration: none">
					one another, and where those things are </span></i><i><span style="text-decoration: none">where
					we live. Part of what draws me to a homesteading lifestyle is that it
					would give me a job where I know I would get to work with my partner
					on it every day.</span></i><i><span style="text-decoration: none"> </span></i>
		</p>
		<blockquote>A wife is needed not solely for cooperation or
			partnership, to lighten the burden, or for</blockquote>
		<blockquote>procreation, sex, or love. More profoundly, it is a union
			of two lonely souls whose existence would be incomplete, who are
			individually overpowered by anxiety for reasons not logically
			apparent, who are ridden with self-doubt in their individual role,
			work or ambition. For such, marriage is an ontological fulfillment,
			not just utilitarian. The word <i>ezer</i> suggest something more
			pragmatically useful than the fact that she 'cooks well'.
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>Thus, unlike all else in nature, man senses his
			loneliness... this is the basis of marriage: to overcome an
			existential incompleteness. The marriage acknowledges the</blockquote>
		<blockquote>unique differences between man and woman; its highest
			rung of fulfillment is attained when it forms an ideological
			commitment.</blockquote>
		<blockquote> - Rav Soloveitchick: “Adam and Eve”</blockquote>
		<p>You may have noticed a pattern by this point. I want my marriage
			to be about more than just sex. I want to love my significant other
			and be loved by them, and I want to feel like I can trust them with
			my very being. I know what it feels like to be alone, and I want my
			partner to fill that hole.</p>
		<blockquote>Contemplating our own Torah world, one is persistently
			struck by the apparent dissonance between the impression conveyed by
			the Talmudic Rabbis and <i>rishonim</i>, respectively. In surveying
			the Gemara... there is little in the way of either squeamish
			embarrassment or outright reservation. There is no revulsion from
			concupiscent pleasure nor recoil from romantic passion.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>[For example,] 'One was wont to say: “When our love was
			intense, a bed the width of a blade was room enough for both of us to
			lie upon. Now that our love is less intense, a [king-size] bed the
			width of 60 cubits does not suffice.”(Sanhedrin 7a)' At one point,
			the Gemara in Brakhot (57b) explores the possibility that sexual
			activity constitutes one of three things which convey a sense of
			<i>me-ein olam ha-bah</i>, a taste of the world to come…</blockquote>
		<blockquote>This harvest stands in marked contrast to positions
			adopted by some of the foremost <i>rishonim</i>. In a major chapter
			of Mishneh Torah, devoted to the rejection of excessive asceticism
			and positioning the Mishna's dictum: 'all your deeds should be for
			the sake of heaven', as an overriding spiritual ideal, Rambam
			evidently found no place for either love of companionship as the
			reason of marital sexuality: “'So too when one has sexual
			relations, he should act in order to maintain his health and
			reproduce. Therefore, he should not have relations any time he
			desires, rather only during the time when he must produce semen as a
			medical need or for the sake of reproduction. Hilchot De'ot (3:2)'”</blockquote>
		<p>I do kinda get the perspective that sex is holy and should not be
			done without consideration, but I also think that it is possible to
			have a close relationship without marriage. I want to bridge this
			gap. I want to appreciate the wonder any pure Ecstasy that sex is,
			while still appreciating that one can have too much of a good thing.
			I would never say that sex should only be for the purpose of
			reproduction, but I also think that it’s important that you have
			some sort of connection with the person you have sex with, and the
			act is, to an extent, surrounded by an agreement of the holyness of
			the moment.</p>
