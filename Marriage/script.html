<p><i><b>The
wedding party</b><span> gathers.</span></i></p>

<p><i><b>The
MC</b><span> says:</span></i><br/>

we have used words and rings<br/>to create the sacred covenant of marriage.<br/>
_______ and _______<br/>
you are about to speak the words<br/>

that will make formally unite you in marriage.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>The
partners</b> say:</i><br/>
Be my covenanted partner, in love and friendship, in peace and
companionship, in the eyes of God and humanity.</p>

<i>They exchange rings inscribed with </i><font face="Lohit Devanagari"><span lang="hi-IN"><i><font face="TlwgTypewriter, monospace">אני
לדודי ודודי לי</font></i></span></font><i>.</i></p>

<p><i><b>The

We promise.<br/>
To protect.<br/>
To serve.<br/>
To learn.<br/>
To grow.<br/>
We promise.<br/>
That your life shall be mine.<br/>
And yours shall be mine.<br/>

The ritual is intentionally short. I don’t see myself having a big
wedding, I think I would be very bored. To me, the wedding would be
the least significant part of a relationship. I think that I can and
will have a strong committed relationship without the assistance of a
large wedding ceremony. I want my wedding to be me and my friends and
my significant other’s friends having fun, and to achieve that I
have cut a lot of things.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
The core of the ceremony is the poem I wrote – it’s very much
inspired by John Adam Ross’ assertion that ritual is performance.
It serves a very similar goal to the ketubah, and for that matter I
might have it inscribed on something to be hung in our home, but
unlike the ketubah, which is written and formal, it would be living,
performed in front of an audience.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
I also really loved the marriage vows from the same sex marriage
document, and I love the passage <font face="Lohit Devanagari"><span lang="hi-IN">אני
לדודי ודודי לי</span></font>, from the song of songs. I
want that to be inscribed on the inside of my ring to remind me and
my partner that we are in a covenant.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
I would imagine that the ceremony would be surrounded by celebration,
but that would be primarily unscripted. I also composed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1gUA5IA28QxEd29HhubTA-svWIFROl0b">playlist</a>
of songs that I would like to played at my wedding, which I think do
a great job of describing how I feel well done relationships work.</p><p></p>
