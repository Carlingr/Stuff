  <h1>South Ferry Ferry Term/Battery Maritime Building
</h1>
  <p>
    The first Elevated Railroad in New York was built in 1870, between Dey st, just north of here, and 13th St. By 1880 the trains traveled to South ferry, and took on passengers from Ferries arriving at this terminal, and was the first sight many immigrants from Ellis Island saw upon Arrival. In the early 1900s seventeen ferry lines crossed the east river.
  Transcontinental traffic often would travel it’s last mile by water too, with many railroads having terminals on the west side of the Hudson river, where cars would be loaded onto barges and brought to their final destination. Waterfront locations would receive car floats, and unload the freight cars at the dock, as if they were a trackside industry. You’ll pass by the location of one of the offices owned by the B&O railroad to manage this traffic when you walk up Broadway later.
  Railroads also moved passengers by car float - cars would be loaded onto a terminal float in New Jersey, and the float would be brought across the river to docks in New York.
